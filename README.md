# Typing Game

Welcome to the Typing Game! This is a simple typing speed test game built with React and Vite. The goal is to type the words that appear on the screen as quickly and accurately as possible before the timer runs out.

## Features

- Randomly generated words for typing practice
- Timer countdown
- Real-time feedback on typing accuracy
- Game over screen displaying Words Per Minute (WPM)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd typing-game
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you prefer using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server to see the app in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.

### Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the directory structure:

- `src/`
  - `components/` - Contains React components like `Header` and `Game`.
  - `App.jsx` - The main application component.
  - `index.jsx` - The entry point of the application.
  - `index.css` - Global styles for the application.
- `public/`
  - `index.html` - The main HTML file for the application.
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration file.

### Usage

1. **Starting a New Game:** When you first load the game or click the "New Game" button, a new set of words will appear, and the timer will start.
2. **Typing:** Type the words as they appear. The game will track your accuracy and progress.
3. **Game Over:** When the timer reaches zero, the game will end, and you'll see your Words Per Minute (WPM) score.
